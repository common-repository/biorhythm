The plugin displays the biorhythm in the sidebar. You need to set only the birth date and the calculation date.

== Description ==

The biorhythm image will contain the physical, emotional, intellectual and intuitiv cycles in different color dots.
You may change the number of dots, colors, labels and size of picture.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `biorhythm.zip`
2. Upload the folder `biorhythm` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
4. Add the plugin to the sidebar through the Appearance/Widgets menu in WordPress
5. Make sure the sub-directory `img` is writable.

In the folder `img` the plugin will store the pictures of the biorhythms of your visitors.
Each file is about 1.5KB so you will have to cleanup sometimes.
